menuconfig GENERIC_PWM
	tristate "PWM Support"
	default n
	help
	  Enables PWM device support implemented via a generic
	  framework.  If unsure, say N.

config ECAP_PWM
	tristate "eCAP PWM support"
	select HAVE_PWM
	depends on GENERIC_PWM && ARCH_DAVINCI_DA850
	help
	  This option enables device driver support for eCAP module found
	  on DA8xx Processors. eCAP module is used to geenrate wide range
	  of PWM waveforms. Maximum frequency generated is equal to half
	  the system clock frequency.
	  Say Y to enable the eCAP support. If unsure, say N.
